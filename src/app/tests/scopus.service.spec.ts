Process performance indicators (PPIs) allow the quantitative evaluation of business processes, providing essential information for decision making. It is common practice today that business processes and PPIs are usually modelled separately using graphical notations for the former and natural language for the latter. This approach makes PPI definitions simple to read and write, but it hinders maintenance consistency between business processes and PPIs. It also requires their manual translation into lower-level implementation languages for their operationalisation, which is a time-consuming, error-prone task because of the ambiguities inherent to natural language definitions. In this article, Visual ppinot, a graphical notation for defining PPIs together with business process models, is presented. Its underlying formal metamodel allows the automated processing of PPIs. Furthermore, it improves current state-of-the-art proposals in terms of expressiveness and in terms of providing an explicit visualisation of the link between PPIs and business processes, which avoids inconsistencies and promotes their co-evolution. The reference implementation, developed as a complete tool suite, has allowed its validation in a multiple-case study, in which five dimensions of Visual ppinot were studied: expressiveness, precision, automation, understandability, and traceability.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22333454800","authid":"22333454800","authname":"Durán A.","surname":"Durán","given-name":"Amador","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6507957743","authid":"6507957743","authname":"Bernárdez B.","surname":"Bernárdez","given-name":"Beatriz","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56264687600","authid":"56264687600","authname":"Toro M.","surname":"Toro","given-name":"Miguel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Business process management | Business process modelling | Graphical notation | Key performance indicators | Process performance indicators | Process performance measurement | Visual PPINOT","source-id":"14490","fund-no":"P12-TIC-1867","fund-sponsor":"Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062332410"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062332410?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062332410&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85062332410&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85062332410","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85062332410","eid":"2-s2.0-85062332410","dc:title":"Measuring performance in knowledge-intensive processes","dc:creator":"Estrada-Torres B.","prism:publicationName":"ACM Transactions on Internet Technology","prism:issn":"15335399","prism:eIssn":"15576051","prism:volume":"19","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2019-02-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"February 2019","prism:doi":"10.1145/3289180","dc:description":"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Knowledge-intensive Processes (KIPs) are processes whose execution is heavily dependent on knowledge workers performing various interconnected knowledge-intensive decision-making tasks. Among other characteristics, KIPs are usually non-repeatable, collaboration-oriented, unpredictable, and, in many cases, driven by implicit knowledge, derived from the capabilities and previous experiences of participants. Despite the growing body of research focused on understanding KIPs and on proposing systems to support these KIPs, the research question on how to define performance measures thereon remains open. In this article, we address this issue with a proposal to enable the performance management of KIPs. Our approach comprises an ontology that allows us to define process performance indicators (PPIs) in the context of KIPs, and a methodology that builds on the ontology and the concepts of lead and lag indicators to provide process participants with actionable guidelines that help them conduct the KIP in a way that fulfills a set of performance goals. Both the ontology and the methodology have been applied to a case study of a real organization in Brazil to manage the performance of an Incident Troubleshooting Process within an ICT (Information and Communications Technology) Outsourcing Company.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60005499","afid":"60005499","affilname":"Universidade do Estado do Rio de Janeiro","affiliation-city":"Rio de Janeiro","affiliation-country":"Brazil"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/113166834","afid":"113166834","affilname":"Federal University of the State of Rio de Janeiro","affiliation-city":"Urca","affiliation-country":"Brazil"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191282590","authid":"57191282590","authname":"Estrada-Torres B.","surname":"Estrada-Torres","given-name":"Bedilia","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56342728100","authid":"56342728100","authname":"Richetti P.","surname":"Richetti","given-name":"Pedro Henrique Piccoli","initials":"P.H.P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"113166834"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"Del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"Del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603350945","authid":"6603350945","authname":"Baião F.","surname":"Baião","given-name":"Fernanda Araujo","initials":"F.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/10040209400","authid":"10040209400","authname":"Santoro F.","surname":"Santoro","given-name":"Flávia Maria","initials":"F.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60005499"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Knowledge-intensive processes | Performance measure | Process performance indicators","article-number":"15","source-id":"15773","fund-acr":"FEDER","fund-no":"304469/2014-9","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065670893"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065670893?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065670893&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85065670893&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85065670893","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85065670893","eid":"2-s2.0-85065670893","dc:title":"A hybrid reliability metric for SLA predictive monitoring","dc:creator":"Comuzzi M.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings of the ACM Symposium on Applied Computing","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450359337"}],"prism:volume":"Part F147772","prism:pageRange":"32-39","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1145/3297280.3297285","dc:description":"© 2019 Association for Computing Machinery. Modern SLA management includes SLA prediction based on data collected during service operations. Besides overall accuracy of a prediction model, decision makers should be able to measure the reliability of individual predictions before taking important decisions, such as whether to renegotiate an SLA. Measures of reliability of individual predictions provided by machine learning techniques tend to depend strictly on the technique chosen and to neglect the features of the system generating the data used to learn a model, i.e., the service provisioning landscape in this case. In this paper, we consider business process-aware service provisioning and we define a hybrid measure of reliability of an individual SLA prediction for classification models, which accounts for both the reliability of the chosen prediction technique, if available, and features capturing the variability of the service provisioning scenario. The metric is evaluated empirically using SLAs and process event logs of a real world case.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103153","afid":"60103153","affilname":"Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Ulsan","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23007964200","authid":"23007964200","authname":"Comuzzi M.","surname":"Comuzzi","given-name":"Marco","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103153"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36612081600","authid":"36612081600","authname":"Marquez-Chamorro A.","surname":"Marquez-Chamorro","given-name":"Alfonso E.","initials":"A.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Business process | Predictive monitoring | Reliability | SLA monitoring","source-id":"21100905622","fund-no":"2017076589","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064855971"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064855971?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064855971&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85064855971&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85064855971","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85064855971","eid":"2-s2.0-85064855971","dc:title":"Does your accurate process predictive monitoring model give reliable predictions?","dc:creator":"Comuzzi M.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783030176419"}],"prism:volume":"11434 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"367-373","prism:coverDate":"2019-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2019","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-030-17642-6_30","dc:description":"© Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2019.

Nowadays, process mining is becoming a growing area of interest in business process management (BPM). Process mining consists in the extraction of information from the event logs of a business process. From this information, we can discover process models, monitor and improve our processes. One of the applications of process mining, is the predictive monitoring of business process. The aim of these techniques is the prediction of quantifiable metrics of a running process instance with the generation of predictive models. The most representative approaches for the runtime prediction of business process are summarized in this paper. The different types of computational predictive methods, such as statistical techniques or machine learning approaches, and certain aspects as the type of predicted values and quality evaluation metrics, have been considered for the categorization of these methods. This paper also includes a summary of the basic concepts, as well as a global overview of the process predictive monitoring area, that can be used to support future efforts of researchers and practitioners in this research field.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36612081600","authid":"36612081600","authname":"Marquez-Chamorro A.","surname":"Marquez-Chamorro","given-name":"Alfonso Eduardo","initials":"A.E.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortes A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortes","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Business process management | predictive monitoring | process indicators | process mining","article-number":"8103817","source-id":"18300156728","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032361188"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032361188?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032361188&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85032361188&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85032361188","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85032361188","eid":"2-s2.0-85032361188","dc:title":"A template-based approach for responsibility management in executable business processes","dc:creator":"Cabanillas C.","prism:publicationName":"Enterprise Information Systems","prism:issn":"17517575","prism:eIssn":"17517583","prism:volume":"12","prism:issueIdentifier":"5","prism:pageRange":"550-586","prism:coverDate":"2018-05-28","prism:coverDisplayDate":"28 May 2018","prism:doi":"10.1080/17517575.2017.1390166","dc:description":"© 2017 The Author(s). Published by Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor  &  Francis Group. Process-oriented organisations need to manage the different types of responsibilities their employees may have w.r.t. the activities involved in their business processes. Despite several approaches provide support for responsibility modelling, in current Business Process Management Systems (BPMS) the only responsibility considered at runtime is the one related to performing the work required for activity completion. Others like accountability or consultation must be implemented by manually adding activities in the executable process model, which is time-consuming and error-prone. In this paper, we address this limitation by enabling current BPMS to execute processes in which people with different responsibilities interact to complete the activities. We introduce a metamodel based on Responsibility Assignment Matrices (RAM) to model the responsibility assignment for each activity, and a flexible template-based mechanism that automatically transforms such information into BPMN elements, which can be interpreted and executed by a BPMS. Thus, our approach does not enforce any specific behaviour for the different responsibilities but new templates can be modelled to specify the interaction that best suits the activity requirements. Furthermore, libraries of templates can be created and reused in different processes. We provide a reference implementation and build a library of templates for a well-known set of responsibilities.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000583","afid":"60000583","affilname":"Wirtschaftsuniversitat Wien","affiliation-city":"Vienna","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42960890100","authid":"42960890100","authname":"Cabanillas C.","surname":"Cabanillas","given-name":"Cristina","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000583"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"BPMN | Business process management | RAL | resource assignment matrix | responsibility management","source-id":"10900153330","fund-no":"V 569-N31","fund-sponsor":"Austrian Science Fund","openaccess":"1","openaccessFlag":true},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058151934"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058151934?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058151934&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85058151934&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85058151934","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85058151934","eid":"2-s2.0-85058151934","dc:title":"Automated Validation of Compensable SLAs","dc:creator":"Muller C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","prism:eIssn":"19391374","prism:pageRange":null,"prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSC.2018.2885766","dc:description":"IEEE A Service Level Agreement (SLA) regulates the provisioning of a service by defining a set of guarantees. Each guarantee sets a Service Level Objective (SLO) on some service metrics, and optionally a compensation that is applied when the SLO is unfulfilled or overfulfilled. Currently, there are software tools and research proposals that use the information about compensations to automate and optimise certain parts of the service management. However, they assume that compensations are well defined, which is too optimistic in some circumstances and can lead to undesirable situations. In this article we discuss about the notion of validity of guarantees with a compensation, which we refer to as compensable guarantees (CG). We describe an abstract model of CGs and we provide a technique that leverages constraint satisfaction problem solvers to automatically validate them. We also present a materialisation of the model of CGs in iAgree, a language to specify SLAs and a tooling support that implements our whole approach. An assessment over 319 CGs taken from 24 real-world SLAs suggests that the expressiveness and effectiveness of our proposal can pave the way for using CGs in a safer and more reliable way.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"undefined","subtypeDescription":null,"author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728096900","authid":"55728096900","authname":"Muller C.","surname":"Muller","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57203398913","authid":"57203398913","authname":"Gutierrez Fernandez A.","surname":"Gutierrez Fernandez","given-name":"Antonio Manuel","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56365074900","authid":"56365074900","authname":"Fernandez P.","surname":"Fernandez","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8656497700","authid":"8656497700","authname":"Martin-Diaz O.","surname":"Martin-Diaz","given-name":"Octavio","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortes A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortes","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analysis | Compensation | CSP | Penalty | Re23 ward | SLA | Validation | WS-Agreement","source-id":"18300156728","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048474420"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048474420?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048474420&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85048474420&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85048474420","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85048474420","eid":"2-s2.0-85048474420","dc:title":"On the relationships between decision management and performance measurement","dc:creator":"Estrada-Torres B.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319915623"}],"prism:volume":"10816 LNCS","prism:pageRange":"311-326","prism:coverDate":"2018-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2018","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-91563-0_19","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2018. Decision management is of utmost importance for the achievement of strategic and operational goals in any organisational context. Therefore, decisions should be considered as first-class citizens that need to be modelled, analysed, monitored to track their performance, and redesigned if necessary. Up to now, existing literature that studies decisions in the context of business processes has focused on the analysis of the definition of decisions themselves, in terms of accuracy, certainty, consistency, covering and correctness. However, to the best of our knowledge, no prior work exists that analyses the relationship between decisions and performance measurement. This paper identifies and analyses this relationship from three different perspectives, namely: the impact of decisions on process performance, the performance measurement of decisions, and the use of performance indicators in the definition of decisions. Furthermore, we also introduce solutions for the representation of these relationships based, amongst others, on the DMN standard.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191282590","authid":"57191282590","authname":"Estrada-Torres B.","surname":"Estrada-Torres","given-name":"Bedilia","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Decision management | DMN | Performance indicators | Performance measurement | PPINOT","source-id":"25674","fund-acr":"FEDER","fund-no":"P12-TIC-1867","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020486298"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020486298?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020486298&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85020486298&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "full-text", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/article/eid/1-s2.0-S0957417417303950"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85020486298","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85020486298","eid":"2-s2.0-85020486298","dc:title":"Run-time prediction of business process indicators using evolutionary decision rules","dc:creator":"Márquez-Chamorro A.","prism:publicationName":"Expert Systems with Applications","prism:issn":"09574174","prism:volume":"87","prism:pageRange":"1-14","prism:coverDate":"2017-11-30","prism:coverDisplayDate":"30 November 2017","prism:doi":"10.1016/j.eswa.2017.05.069","pii":"S0957417417303950","dc:description":"© 2017 Elsevier Ltd Predictive monitoring of business processes is a challenging topic of process mining which is concerned with the prediction of process indicators of running process instances.

The definition of suitable Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) is a crucial task in this regard. Because PPIs need to be in line with strategic business objectives, the formulation of PPIs is a managerial concern. Managers typically start out to provide relevant indicators in the form of natural language PPI descriptions. Therefore, considerable time and effort have to be invested to transform these descriptions into PPI definitions that can actually be monitored. This work presents an approach that automates this task. The presented approach transforms an unstructured natural language PPI description into a structured notation that is aligned with the implementation underlying a business process. To do so, we combine Hidden Markov Models and semantic matching techniques. A quantitative evaluation on the basis of a data collection obtained from practice demonstrates that our approach works accurately. Therefore, it represents a viable automated alternative to an otherwise laborious manual endeavor.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032882","afid":"60032882","affilname":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008734","afid":"60008734","affilname":"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","affiliation-city":"Amsterdam","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6604024016","authid":"6604024016","authname":"van der Aa H.","surname":"van der Aa","given-name":"Han","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008734"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36245147600","authid":"36245147600","authname":"Leopold H.","surname":"Leopold","given-name":"Henrik","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008734"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603060277","authid":"6603060277","authname":"Reijers H.","surname":"Reijers","given-name":"Hajo A.","initials":"H.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008734"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032882"}]}],"authkeywords":"Hidden Markov Models | Model alignment | Natural language processing | Performance measurement | Process Performance Indicators","source-id":"12305","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85022209202"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85022209202?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85022209202&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85022209202&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85022209202","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85022209202","eid":"2-s2.0-85022209202","dc:title":"Specifying Compensations with WS-Agreement","dc:creator":"Muller C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Latin America Transactions","prism:issn":"15480992","prism:volume":"15","prism:issueIdentifier":"7","prism:pageRange":"1335-1341","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1109/TLA.2017.7959515","dc:description":"© 2003-2012 IEEE. During the last years the use of service level agree-ments (SLA) is rising uncontrollably to describe the rights and obligations of parties involved in service provisioning (typically the service consumer and the service provider); amongst other information, SLA could define guarantees associated with the idea of service level objectives (SLOs) that normally represent key performance indicators of either the consumer or the provider. In case the guarantee is under or over fulfilled SLAs could also define some compensations (i.e. penalties or rewards). In such a context, there have been important steps towards the automation of the analysis of SLAs. One of these steps is a characterization model of SLAs with compensations proposed by the authors in a previous work; and another step is the standardisation effort in the SLAs notation made by WSâ€'Agreement. However, real-world SLAs includes complex concepts that must be considered, namely: (i) SLA terms that specify compensations without an explicit SLO; and (ii) a limit for the compensations. In this paper we extend our prior characterization model considering these complex concepts. Specifically, (i) we provide up to five real-world scenarios whose SLAs incorporate aforementioned new concepts; (ii) we extend our model for compensable guarantees considering terms without an explicit SLO; and (iii) we provide a novel WSâ€'Agreement-based syntax to model SLAs with compensations considering these concepts. These contributions aim to establish a foundation to elaborate tools that could provide an automated support to model and analyse SLAs with compensations.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728096900","authid":"55728096900","authname":"Muller C.","surname":"Muller","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56365074900","authid":"56365074900","authname":"Fernandez P.","surname":"Fernandez","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194784709","authid":"57194784709","authname":"Diaz O.","surname":"Diaz","given-name":"Octavio Martin","initials":"O.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35487245400","authid":"35487245400","authname":"Gutierrez A.","surname":"Gutierrez","given-name":"Antonio M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57194709174","authid":"57194709174","authname":"Cortes A.","surname":"Cortes","given-name":"Antonio Ruiz","initials":"A.R.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Compensation | Penalty | Reward | Service Level Agreement | SLA | WSâ€'Agreement","article-number":"7959515","source-id":"19700181218","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029508761"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029508761?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029508761&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85029508761&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85029508761","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85029508761","eid":"2-s2.0-85029508761","dc:title":"A new framework for defining realistic SLAs: An evidence-based approach","dc:creator":"Cho M.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","prism:issn":"18651348","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319650142"}],"prism:volume":"297","prism:pageRange":"19-35","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-65015-9_2","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing AG 2017. In a changing and competitive business world, business processes are at the heart of modern organizations. In some cases, service level agreements (SLAs) are used to regulate how these business processes are provided. This is usually the case when the business process is outsourced, and some guarantees about how the outsourcing service is provided are required. Although some work has been done concerning the structure of SLAs for business processes, the definition of service level objectives (SLOs) remains a manual task performed by experts based on their previous knowledge and intuition. Therefore, an evidence-based approach that curtails humans involvement is required for the definition of realistic while challenging SLOs. This is the purpose of this paper, where performance-focused process mining, goal programming optimization techniques, and simulation techniques have been availed to implement an evidence-based framework for the definition of SLAs. Furthermore, the applicability of the proposed framework has been evaluated in a case study carried out in a hospital scenario.","citedby-count":"1","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60103153","afid":"60103153","affilname":"Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Ulsan","affiliation-country":"South Korea"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032330","afid":"60032330","affilname":"Pohang University of Science and Technology","affiliation-city":"Pohang","affiliation-country":"South Korea"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57204887084","authid":"57204887084","authname":"Cho M.","surname":"Cho","given-name":"Minsu","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60103153"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032330"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57198324241","authid":"57198324241","authname":"Song M.","surname":"Song","given-name":"Minseok","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032330"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728096900","authid":"55728096900","authname":"Müller C.","surname":"Müller","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56365074900","authid":"56365074900","authname":"Fernandez P.","surname":"Fernandez","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Goal programming | Optimization | Process mining | Process performance indicators | Service level agreement | Simulation","source-id":"17500155101","fund-no":"645751","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019219263"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019219263?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019219263&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=85019219263&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/85019219263","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:85019219263","eid":"2-s2.0-85019219263","dc:title":"Redefining a process engine as a microservice platform","dc:creator":"Gutiérrez–Fernández A.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","prism:issn":"18651348","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319584560"}],"prism:volume":"281","prism:pageRange":"252-263","prism:coverDate":"2017-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2017","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-58457-7_19","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing AG 2017.

As each microservice is developed and deployed independently, they can be developed in the platform and programming language that best suite their purposes, using a simple communication protocol, as REST APIs or asynchronous event-based collaborations, to compose them. In this paper, we argue that process engines provide an excellent platform to develop microservices whose business logic involves complex work flows or processes so that a Business Process language can be used as high-level language to develop these services and a process engine to execute it.

The continuous performance improvement of business processes usually involves the definition of a set of process performance indicators (PPIs) with their target values. These PPIs can be classified into lag PPIs, which establish a goal that the organization is trying to achieve, though are not directly influenceable by process performers, and lead PPIs, which are influenceable by process performers and have a predictable impact on the lag indicator. Determining thresholds for lead PPIs that enable the fulfillment of the related lag PPI is a key task, which is usually done based on the experience and intuition of the process owners. However, the amount and nature of currently available data make it possible for data-driven decisions to be made in this regard. This paper proposes a method that applies statistical techniques for thresholds determination successfully employed in other domains.

Nowadays, service trading over the Web is gaining momentum. In this highly dynamic scenario, both providers and consumers need to formalize their contractual and legal relationship, creating service level agreements. Although there exist some proposals that provide models to describe that relationship, they usually only cover technical aspects, not providing explicit semantics to the agreement terms. Furthermore, these models cannot be effectively shared on the Web, since they do not actually follow Web principles. These drawbacks hamper take-up and automatic analysis. In this article, we introduce Linked USDL Agreement, a semantic model to specify, manage and share service level agreement descriptions on the Web. This model is part of the Linked USDL family of ontologies that can describe not only technical but also business related aspects of services, incorporating Web principles. We validate our proposal by describing agreements in computational and non-computational scenarios, namely cloud computing and business process outsourcing services. Moreover, we evaluate the actual coverage and expressiveness of Linked USDL Agreement comparing it with existing models. In order to foster its adoption and effectively manage the service level agreement lifecycle, we present an implemented tool that supports creation, automatic analysis, and publication on the Web of agreement descriptions.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60106440","afid":"60106440","affilname":"University of Coimbra, Centre for Informatics and System","affiliation-city":"Coimbra","affiliation-country":"Portugal"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60012113","afid":"60012113","affilname":"Open University","affiliation-city":"Milton Keynes","affiliation-country":"United Kingdom"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7406129984","authid":"7406129984","authname":"García J.","surname":"García","given-name":"José María","initials":"J.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56365074900","authid":"56365074900","authname":"Fernández P.","surname":"Fernández","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15136781500","authid":"15136781500","authname":"Pedrinaci C.","surname":"Pedrinaci","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60012113"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55429578600","authid":"55429578600","authname":"Cardoso J.","surname":"Cardoso","given-name":"Jorge","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60106440"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"business services | quality of services | semantic analysis | semantic modeling | Service level agreements | service management | service trading","article-number":"7519020","source-id":"18300156728","fund-acr":"FEDER","fund-no":"P12-TIC-1867","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989934538"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989934538?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84989934538&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84989934538&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84989934538","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84989934538","eid":"2-s2.0-84989934538","dc:title":"An elasticity-aware governance platform for cloud service delivery","dc:creator":"Muller C.","prism:publicationName":"Proceedings - 2016 IEEE International Conference on Services Computing, SCC 2016","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781509026289"}],"prism:pageRange":"74-81","prism:coverDate":"2016-08-31","prism:coverDisplayDate":"31 August 2016","prism:doi":"10.1109/SCC.2016.17","dc:description":"© 2016 IEEE. In cloud service provisioning scenarios with a changing demand from consumers, it is appealing for cloud providers to leverage only a limited amount of the virtualized resources required to provide the service. However, it is not easy to determine how much resources are required to satisfy consumers expectations in terms of Quality of Service (QoS). Some existing frameworks provide mechanisms to adapt the required cloud resources in the service delivery, also called an elastic service, but only for consumers with the same QoS expectations. The problem arises when the service provider must deal with several consumers, each demanding a different QoS for the service. In such an scenario, cloud resources provisioning must deal with trade-offs between different QoS, while fulfilling these QoS, within the same service deployment. In this paper we propose an elasticity-aware governance platform for cloud service delivery that reacts to the dynamic service load introduced by consumers demand. Such a reaction consists of provisioning the required amount of cloud resources to satisfy the different QoS that is offered to the consumers by means of several service level agreements. The proposed platform aims to keep under control the QoS experienced by multiple service consumers while maintaining a controlled cost.","citedby-count":"2","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60018163","afid":"60018163","affilname":"Technische Universitat Wien","affiliation-city":"Vienna","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728096900","authid":"55728096900","authname":"Muller C.","surname":"Muller","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/7006826705","authid":"7006826705","authname":"Truong H.","surname":"Truong","given-name":"Hong Linh","initials":"H.L.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018163"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56365074900","authid":"56365074900","authname":"Fernandez P.","surname":"Fernandez","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36536836400","authid":"36536836400","authname":"Copil G.","surname":"Copil","given-name":"Georgiana","initials":"G.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018163"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortes A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortes","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6701473617","authid":"6701473617","authname":"Dustdar S.","surname":"Dustdar","given-name":"Schahram","initials":"S.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60018163"}]}],"authkeywords":"Cloud | Elasticity | Governance | Service Delivery | SLA","article-number":"7557438","source-id":"21100781403","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954229384"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954229384?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84954229384&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84954229384&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84954229384","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84954229384","eid":"2-s2.0-84954229384","dc:title":"On the automated analysis of WS-Agreement documents: Applications to the processes of creating and monitoring agreements","dc:creator":"Müller C.","prism:publicationName":"AI Communications","prism:issn":"09217126","prism:volume":"29","prism:issueIdentifier":"1","prism:pageRange":"227-229","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-29","prism:coverDisplayDate":"29 January 2016","prism:doi":"10.3233/AIC-140648","dc:description":"© 2016 - IOS Press and the authors.

The performance perspective of business processes is concerned with the definition of performance requirements usually specified as a set of Process Performance Indicators (PPIs). Like other business process perspectives such as control-flow or data, there are cases in which PPIs are subject to variability. However, although the modelling of business process variability (BPV) has evolved significantly, there are very few contributions addressing the variability in the performance perspective of business processes. Modelling PPI variants with tools and techniques non-suitable for variability may generate redundant models, thus making it difficult its maintenance and future adaptations, also increasing possibility of errors in its managing. In this paper we present different cases of PPI variability detected as result of the analysis of several processes where BPV is present. Based on an existent metamodel used for defining PPIs over BPs, we propose its formal extension that allows the definition of PPI variability according to the cases identified.","citedby-count":"3","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/57191282590","authid":"57191282590","authname":"Estrada-Torres B.","surname":"Estrada-Torres","given-name":"Bedilia","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"Del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"Del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Business process variability | Process performance indicators | Variability in PPIs","source-id":"17500155101","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84948120472"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84948120472?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84948120472&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84948120472&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84948120472","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84948120472","eid":"2-s2.0-84948120472","dc:title":"Using templates and linguistic patterns to define process performance indicators","dc:creator":"del-Río-Ortega A.","prism:publicationName":"Enterprise Information Systems","prism:issn":"17517575","prism:eIssn":"17517583","prism:volume":"10","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"159-192","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"12 February 2016","prism:doi":"10.1080/17517575.2013.867543","dc:description":"© 2014 Taylor  &  Francis. Process performance management (PPM) aims at measuring, monitoring and analysing the performance of business processes (BPs), in order to check the achievement of strategic and operational goals and to support decision-making for their optimisation. PPM is based on process performance indicators (PPIs), so having an appropriate definition of them is crucial. One of the main problems of PPIs definition is to express them in an unambiguous, complete, understandable, traceable and verifiable manner. In practice, PPIs are defined informally – usually in ad hoc, natural language, with its well-known problems – or they are defined from an implementation perspective, hardly understandable to non-technical people. In order to solve this problem, in this article we propose a novel approach to improve the definition of PPIs using templates and linguistic patterns. This approach promotes reuse, reduces both ambiguities and missing information, is understandable to all stakeholders and maintains traceability with the process model. Furthermore, it enables the automated processing of PPI definitions by its straightforward translation into the PPINOT metamodel, allowing the gathering of the required information for their computation as well as the analysis of the relationships between them and with BP elements.","citedby-count":"16","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/22333454800","authid":"22333454800","authname":"Durán A.","surname":"Durán","given-name":"Amador","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"business performance monitoring | business process analysis | business process management | key performance indicators | patterns | process performance indicators | process performance management | templates","source-id":"10900153330","fund-acr":"CICYT","fund-no":"TIN2009-07366","fund-sponsor":"Comisión Interministerial de Ciencia y Tecnología","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976640067"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976640067?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84976640067&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84976640067&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84976640067","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84976640067","eid":"2-s2.0-84976640067","dc:title":"Narrowing the business-IT gap in process performance measurement","dc:creator":"Van Der Aa H.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319396958"}],"prism:volume":"9694","prism:pageRange":"543-557","prism:coverDate":"2016-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2016","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-39696-533","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2016. To determine whether strategic goals are met, organizations must monitor how their business processes perform. Process Performance Indicators (PPIs) are used to specify relevant performance requirements. The formulation of PPIs is typically a managerial concern. Therefore, considerable effort has to be invested to relate PPIs, described by management, to the exact operational and technical characteristics of business processes. This work presents an approach to support this task, which would otherwise be a laborious and time-consuming endeavor. The presented approach can automatically establish links between PPIs, as formulated in natural language, with operational details, as described in process models. To do so, we employ machine learning and natural language processing techniques. A quantitative evaluation on the basis of a collection of 173 real-world PPIs demonstrates that the proposed approach works well.","citedby-count":"4","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60032882","afid":"60032882","affilname":"Technische Universiteit Eindhoven","affiliation-city":"Eindhoven","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60008734","afid":"60008734","affilname":"Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam","affiliation-city":"Amsterdam","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114576819","afid":"114576819","affilname":"Institute for Information Business","affiliation-city":"Vienna","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6604024016","authid":"6604024016","authname":"Van Der Aa H.","surname":"Van Der Aa","given-name":"Han","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008734"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"Del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"Del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36245147600","authid":"36245147600","authname":"Leopold H.","surname":"Leopold","given-name":"Henrik","initials":"H.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008734"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6503908779","authid":"6503908779","authname":"Mendling J.","surname":"Mendling","given-name":"Jan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114576819"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603060277","authid":"6603060277","authname":"Reijers H.","surname":"Reijers","given-name":"Hajo A.","initials":"H.A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60008734"},{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60032882"}]}],"authkeywords":"Model alignment | Natural language processing | Performance measurement | Process performance indicators","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958552645"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958552645?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958552645&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84958552645&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84958552645","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84958552645","eid":"2-s2.0-84958552645","dc:title":"Automated team selection and compliance checking in business processes","dc:creator":"Cabanillas C.","prism:publicationName":"ACM International Conference Proceeding Series","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9781450333467"}],"prism:volume":"24-26-August-2015","prism:pageRange":"42-51","prism:coverDate":"2015-08-24","prism:coverDisplayDate":"24 August 2015","prism:doi":"10.1145/2785592.2785613","dc:description":"© 2015 ACM.

As the use of services available on the Web is becoming mainstream, contracts and legal aspects of the relationship between providers and consumers need to be formalized. However, current proposals to model service level agreements are mostly focused on technical aspects, do not explicitly provide semantics to agreement terms, and do not follow Web principles. These limitations prevent take-up, automatic processing, and effective sharing of agreements. Linked USDL Agreement is a Linked Data based semantic model to describe and share service agreements that extends Linked USDL, which offers a family of languages to describe various technical and business aspects of services. We followed a use case driven approach, evaluating the applicability of our proposal in a cloud computing scenario, and comparing its expressiveness with existing models.

All rights reserved. The human resource perspective of a business process is concerned with the relation between the activities of a process and the actors who take part in them. Unlike other process perspectives, such as control flow, for which many different types of analyses have been proposed, such as finding deadlocks, there is an important gap regarding the human resource perspective. Resource analysis in business processes has not been defined, and only a few analysis operations can be glimpsed in previous approaches. In this paper, we identify and formally define seven design-time analysis operations related to how resources are involved in process activities. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a wide variety of resource-aware BP models, those analysis operations can be automated by leveraging Description Logic (DL) off-the-shelf reasoners. To this end, we rely on Resource Assignment Language (RAL), a domain-specific language that enables the definition of conditions to select the candidates to participate in a process activity. We provide a complete formal semantics for RAL based on DLs and extend it to address the operations, for which the control flow of the process must also be taken into consideration. A proof-of-concept implementation has been developed and integrated in a system called CRISTAL. As a result, we can give an automatic answer to different questions related to the management of resources in business processes at design time.","citedby-count":"20","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000583","afid":"60000583","affilname":"Wirtschaftsuniversitat Wien","affiliation-city":"Vienna","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "4", "$" :"4"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42960890100","authid":"42960890100","authname":"Cabanillas C.","surname":"Cabanillas","given-name":"Cristina","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000583"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"Del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"Del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Analysis operation | Automated analysis | Business process management | Human resource perspective | RAL | Resource assignment","source-id":"12305","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84924206022"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84924206022?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84924206022&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84924206022&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84924206022","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84924206022","eid":"2-s2.0-84924206022","dc:title":"Towards Compensable SLAs","dc:creator":"Müller C.","prism:publicationName":"Communications in Computer and Information Science","prism:issn":"18650929","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783319148854"}],"prism:volume":"508","prism:pageRange":"31-38","prism:coverDate":"2015-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2015","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-14886-1 4","dc:description":"© Springer International Publishing Switzerland 2015. Service Level Agreements (SLA) describe the rights and obligations of parties involved (typically the service consumer and the service provider); amongst other information they could include the definition of compensations: penalties and/or rewards depending on the level of service provided. We coin the concept of Compensable SLAs to such that include compensation information inside. In such a context, in spite of important steps towards the automation of the management of SLAs have been given, the expression of compensations remains as an important challenge to be addressed. In this paper we aim to provide a characterization model to create Compensable SLAs; specifically, the main contributions include: (i) the conceptualization of the Compensation Function to express consistently penalties and rewards.

However, BPO services supported by process–aware information systems could also benefit from modelling SLAs in tasks such as performance monitoring, human resource assignment or process configuration.

In this paper, we introduce RALph, a graphical notation for the assignment of human resources to BP activities. We define its semantics by mapping this notation to a language that has been formally defined in description logics, which enables its automated analysis. Although we show how RALph can be seamlessly integrated with BPMN, it is noteworthy that the notation is independent of the BP modelling language. Altogether, RALph will foster the visual modelling of the resource perspective in BPs.","citedby-count":"29","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60010586","afid":"60010586","affilname":"Universität Ulm","affiliation-city":"Ulm","affiliation-country":"Germany"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000583","afid":"60000583","affilname":"Wirtschaftsuniversitat Wien","affiliation-city":"Vienna","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42960890100","authid":"42960890100","authname":"Cabanillas C.","surname":"Cabanillas","given-name":"Cristina","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000583"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36666622700","authid":"36666622700","authname":"Knuplesch D.","surname":"Knuplesch","given-name":"David","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/9734809800","authid":"9734809800","authname":"Reichert M.","surname":"Reichert","given-name":"Manfred","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60010586"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6503908779","authid":"6503908779","authname":"Mendling J.","surname":"Mendling","given-name":"Jan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000583"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"BPM | Graphical notation | RALph | Resource assignment","source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919764236"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919764236?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919764236&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84919764236&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84919764236","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84919764236","eid":"2-s2.0-84919764236","dc:title":"Automated analysis of conflicts in WS-agreement","dc:creator":"Müller C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","prism:issn":"19391374","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"4","prism:pageRange":"530-544","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"OCTOBER/DECEMBER 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSC.2013.9","dc:description":"© 2013 IEEE. WS-Agreement is one of the most widely used SLA specifications. An advantage of WS-Agreement over other agreement metamodels is that it allows one to define conditional and optional term sets inside an agreement document, which are commonly found features in real-world agreements. Unfortunately, they increase the complexity of the automated detection and explanation of conflicts between SLA terms, leading to new kinds of conflicts that are not supported by current techniques. Furthermore, creating a general-purpose conflict analyser in WS-Agreement is a hard task since it should understand the semantics of an unbounded number of languages that can be used in the eight extension points that WS-Agreement includes for the sake of flexibility. In this article, we address these issues by providing a conflict classification for SLAs that includes new conflicts derived from the use of conditional and optional term sets; and a novel language-agnostic technique based on constraint satisfaction problems to automatically detect and explain these conflicts. In pursuing these results, we defined some WS-Agreement concepts as well as a fully-fledged WS-Agreement-compliant language. The developed technique and its reference implementation have been thoroughly validated.","citedby-count":"12","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "3", "$" :"3"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728096900","authid":"55728096900","authname":"Müller C.","surname":"Müller","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Conflict management | Consistency | Service level agreement | SLA | WS-agreement","article-number":"6464252","source-id":"18300156728","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84910012805"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84910012805?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84910012805&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84910012805&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84910012805","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84910012805","eid":"2-s2.0-84910012805","dc:title":"Towards a formal specification of SLAs with compensations*","dc:creator":"Müller C.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Computer Science (including subseries Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence and Lecture Notes in Bioinformatics)","prism:issn":"03029743","prism:eIssn":"16113349","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783662455623"}],"prism:volume":"8841","prism:pageRange":"295-312","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","dc:description":"© Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014. In Cooperative Information Systems, service level agreements (SLA) can be used to describe the rights and obligations of parties involved in the transactions (typically the service consumer and the service provider); amongst other information, SLA could define guarantees associated with the idea of service level objectives (SLOs) that normally represent key performance indicators of either the consumer or the provider. In case the guarantee is under-fulfilled or over-fulfilled SLAs could also define some compensations (i.e. penalties or rewards). In such a context, during the last years there have been important steps towards the automation of the management of SLAs, however the formalization of compensations in SLAs still remains as an important challenge.In this paper we aim to provide a characterization model to create SLAs with compensations; specifically, the main contributions are twofold: (i) the conceptualization of the Compensation Function to express consistently penalties and rewards and (ii) a model for Compens-able Guarantees that associate SLOs with Compensation Functions. This formalization models aim to establish a foundation to elaborate tools that could provide an automated support to the modeling and analysis of SLAs with compensations. Additionally, in order to validate our approach, we model and analyze a set of guarantee terms from three real world examples of SLAs and our formalization proves to be useful for detecting mistakes that are typically derived from the manual specification of SLAs in natural language.","citedby-count":"5","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728096900","authid":"55728096900","authname":"Müller C.","surname":"Müller","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/35487245400","authid":"35487245400","authname":"Gutiérrez A.","surname":"Gutiérrez","given-name":"Antonio M.","initials":"A.M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8656497700","authid":"8656497700","authname":"Martín-Díaz O.","surname":"Martín-Díaz","given-name":"Octavio","initials":"O.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56365074900","authid":"56365074900","authname":"Fernández P.","surname":"Fernández","given-name":"Pablo","initials":"P.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"source-id":"25674","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84903125151"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84903125151?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84903125151&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84903125151&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84903125151","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84903125151","eid":"2-s2.0-84903125151","dc:title":"Comprehensive explanation of SLA violations at runtime","dc:creator":"Müller C.","prism:publicationName":"IEEE Transactions on Services Computing","prism:issn":"19391374","prism:volume":"7","prism:issueIdentifier":"2","prism:pageRange":"168-183","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"April/June 2014","prism:doi":"10.1109/TSC.2013.45","dc:description":"Service Level Agreements (SLAs) establish the Quality of Service (QoS) agreed between service-based systems consumers and providers.

The resulting platform, SALMonADA, receives the SLA agreed between the parties as input and reports timely and comprehensive explanations of SLA violations. SALMonADA performs an automated monitoring configuration and it analyses highly expressive SLAs by means of a constraint satisfaction problems based technique. We have evaluated the impact of SALMonADA over the resulting service consumption time performance. The results are satisfactory enough to consider SALMonADA for SLA supervision because of its low intrusiveness. © 2013 IEEE.","citedby-count":"38","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60007592","afid":"60007592","affilname":"Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya","affiliation-city":"Barcelona","affiliation-country":"Spain"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Journal","subtype":"ar","subtypeDescription":"Article","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "7", "$" :"7"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55728096900","authid":"55728096900","authname":"Müller C.","surname":"Müller","given-name":"Carlos","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/53880191200","authid":"53880191200","authname":"Oriol M.","surname":"Oriol","given-name":"Marc","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6603081752","authid":"6603081752","authname":"Franch X.","surname":"Franch","given-name":"Xavier","initials":"X.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/8332219900","authid":"8332219900","authname":"Marco J.","surname":"Marco","given-name":"Jordi","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007592"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "7", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/55793189239","authid":"55793189239","authname":"Rodríguez M.","surname":"Rodríguez","given-name":"Marc","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60007592"}]}],"authkeywords":"analysis | monitoring | QoS | Service level agreement | SLA | violation detection and explanation","article-number":"6606792","source-id":"18300156728","fund-acr":"EC","fund-no":"undefined","fund-sponsor":"European Commission","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904566806"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904566806?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904566806&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84904566806&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84904566806","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84904566806","eid":"2-s2.0-84904566806","dc:title":"Towards process-aware cross-organizational human resource management","dc:creator":"Cabanillas C.","prism:publicationName":"Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing","prism:issn":"18651348","prism:isbn": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"9783662437445"}],"prism:volume":"175 LNBIP","prism:pageRange":"79-93","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","prism:doi":"10.1007/978-3-662-43745-2","dc:description":"Finding human resources with the required set of skills, experience, and availability to execute an activity at a specific moment, is a socio-technical challenge for enterprises that use business-process aware systems. On an intra-organizational level, there exists an increasing body of knowledge for automated human-resource management. However, the recent pervasiveness of service-oriented cloud computing combined with mobile devices and big data, has resulted in the emergence of crossorganizational ecosystems in which workforce is distributed. Consequently, human-resource management has to consider more requirements compared to a purely intra-organizational setting. This position paper addresses the gap and describes a set of challenges in the management of human resources in service outsourcing scenarios based on process views and automatic process-view matching. The contribution is a specification of research directions that must be pursued so that resource management successfully adopts the special requirements for scaling to a cross-organizational level. © Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg 2014.","citedby-count":"8","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60068861","afid":"60068861","affilname":"Tallinn University of Technology","affiliation-city":"Tallinn","affiliation-country":"Estonia"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60000583","afid":"60000583","affilname":"Wirtschaftsuniversitat Wien","affiliation-city":"Vienna","affiliation-country":"Austria"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Book Series","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "5", "$" :"5"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/42960890100","authid":"42960890100","authname":"Cabanillas C.","surname":"Cabanillas","given-name":"Cristina","initials":"C.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000583"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/23036260500","authid":"23036260500","authname":"Norta A.","surname":"Norta","given-name":"Alex","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60068861"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/6503908779","authid":"6503908779","authname":"Mendling J.","surname":"Mendling","given-name":"Jan","initials":"J.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60000583"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]}],"authkeywords":"Human resource management | Process matching | Process view | Resource allocation | Resource assignment | Service outsourcing","source-id":"17500155101","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false},{"@_fa": "true", "link": [{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "self", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84915775932"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "author-affiliation", "@href": "https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84915775932?field=author,affiliation"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84915775932&origin=inward"},{"@_fa": "true", "@ref": "scopus-citedby", "@href": "https://www.scopus.com/inward/citedby.uri?partnerID=HzOxMe3b&scp=84915775932&origin=inward"}],"prism:url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/abstract/scopus_id/84915775932","dc:identifier":"SCOPUS_ID:84915775932","eid":"2-s2.0-84915775932","dc:title":"KPIshare: A collaborative space for BPM practitioners for full definitions and discussions on process KPIs","dc:creator":"Resinas M.","prism:publicationName":"CEUR Workshop Proceedings","prism:issn":"16130073","prism:volume":"1295","prism:pageRange":"61-65","prism:coverDate":"2014-01-01","prism:coverDisplayDate":"2014","dc:description":"Copyright © 2014 for this paper by its authors. Copying permitted for private and academic purposes. The definition of process-related key performance indicators (KPIs) is a key part of performance measurement and one of the most challenging because of the lack of one best way to define business-applicable KPIs that are both aligned with the strategic goals that the organisation wants to achieve and, at the same time, measurable and as objective as possible. In this demo, we present KPIshare, which is a web platform whose main goal is to provide the BPM community with a knowledge base of well-defined, mature KPIs and a place where they can discuss, collaborate and create process-related KPIs that are applicable in real business situations. To this end, KPIshare introduces a detailed structure for KPI definition and the concept of operational KPI challenge as a mechanism to foster the collaboration in the platform.","citedby-count":"0","affiliation": [{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/60033284","afid":"60033284","affilname":"University of Seville","affiliation-city":"Sevilla","affiliation-country":"Spain"},{"@_fa": "true", "affiliation-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/affiliation/affiliation_id/114799158","afid":"114799158","affilname":"CUPENYA BV","affiliation-city":"Amsterdam","affiliation-country":"Netherlands"}],"prism:aggregationType":"Conference Proceeding","subtype":"cp","subtypeDescription":"Conference Paper","author-count":{"@limit": "100", "@total": "6", "$" :"6"},"author": [{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "1", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15021461000","authid":"15021461000","authname":"Resinas M.","surname":"Resinas","given-name":"Manuel","initials":"M.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "2", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/36704589800","authid":"36704589800","authname":"Del-Río-Ortega A.","surname":"Del-Río-Ortega","given-name":"Adela","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "3", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/15120180100","authid":"15120180100","authname":"Ruiz-Cortés A.","surname":"Ruiz-Cortés","given-name":"Antonio","initials":"A.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"60033284"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "4", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56440034400","authid":"56440034400","authname":"Blattner D.","surname":"Blattner","given-name":"Dominik","initials":"D.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114799158"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "5", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56439953500","authid":"56439953500","authname":"Tasheva K.","surname":"Tasheva","given-name":"Kristina","initials":"K.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114799158"}]},{"@_fa": "true", "@seq": "6", "author-url":"https://api.elsevier.com/content/author/author_id/56440180300","authid":"56440180300","authname":"Chipev B.","surname":"Chipev","given-name":"Bozhan","initials":"B.","afid": [{"@_fa": "true", "$" :"114799158"}]}],"source-id":"21100218356","fund-no":"undefined","openaccess":"0","openaccessFlag":false}]}}}
